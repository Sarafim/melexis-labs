Question 2.1 Write advantages and disadvantages of behavioral design style

Advantages:
-The Behavioral description in Verilog is used to describe the function of a design in an algorithmic manner. 
-Behavioral modeling in Verilog uses constructs similar to C language constructs.
-Allows describing complex logic
-Easy  to use and to understand 
Disadvantages
-Synthesizer create what it wants


Question 2.2 – Write advantages and disadvantages of structural design style

Advantages:
-Describe digital circuits with certain structure
-Synthesizer will create exactly the same circuit that you described (perhaps with some optimizations).
-Simplifying of development process
Disadvantages
-A lot of code and as a result large number of errors
-You must exactly know what you want

Question 2.3 – In what cases the behavioral design style should be used and when it is better to apply structural design style?
Explain with examples. Can these two design style be mixed in one project?

Behavioral design style should been used during the description of standard structures, 
blocks and modules for instance adder, multiplier, register, count and e.g. But if designer want
to create his own new count, or another module with certain structure, then he must use structural style. 
Designer can use structural style when synthesizer cannot satisfy all constrains.
In such situation designer decides that it is possible to remake to achieve the correct design.  

Question 2.4 – Compare conditional compilation with the aid of `ifdef statement and generate 
construct. What advantages and disadvantages of each approach? When is preferable using 
each of them?

Conditional compilation of Verilog code with the aid of preprocessor’s `idef, `else, `endif supported since 1995 version of Verilog’s standard.
So you can safely use this feature in your projects, because almost all Verilog simulators and synthesizers support it. 

Generate construct allows to conditionally compile Verilog code and instantiate modules. 
It is more powerful than conditional compilation with `ifdef statement, because generate allows using branching (if, case) and 
for-loops.
The main drawback of generate construct is that it was added in Verilog-2001, so the old design tools, oriented to Verilog-1995, not support it, 
creating problems with code portability.
