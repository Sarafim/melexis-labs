In case of one-hot encoding only one bit at time will equal to one, so there is no need in prioritization logic and
we tell to synthesizer about this with the aid of parallel_case statement. 
This leads to synthesizing smaller and faster circuit. 
We also can don’t restore FSM from illegal states in default statement 
(we can suppose that our device will never fall in circumstances that lead to illegal states) and
add full_case statement together with parallel_case. 
This will add extra optimization to speed and area of our FSM but reduce its reliability.
